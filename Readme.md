**Esri Web AppBuilder Georeference Plats Widget**

The purpose of the georeference plats widget is to give the user the ability to upload a JPG or PNG image of a plat drawing, overlay it with the current map extent, and add it to the map as an image overlay.  The widget will allow the user to stretch, move, and position the image to a desired location on the map before adding it as a map image layer.

Currently supported upload formats include:
* JPEG
* PNG

This widget uses the Konva library for image overlay and positioning: [https://konvajs.github.io/](https://konvajs.github.io/)
